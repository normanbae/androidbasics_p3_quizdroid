Hi All,

Here's my "Project 3" for the Android Basics course.

I created a quiz app that tests one's knowledge of Android.

I tried to incorporate a little bit of everything we learned in the course while also throwing in some other things I found online (i.e. progress bar).

I'm thinking about adding a "Share to Social Media" button, selection of other quizzes, more detailed email summary and other languages.
